# Work_out_Classification_Neural_Network_No_Lib
Nerual Network with no libraries other than Numpy and MatPlot


I think that This project will be fun and A good first start to being able to test myself at computer vision. I think that this is honestly a pretty hard first try, 
as this is my first shot at something with computer vision, and I am building a NN using only two libraries. NumPy and Matplot. I think that this is a fun and challenging
for my first computer vison project. I think that the only constraints I personally have with these massive projects is that the GPU in my system is in need
for an update. The 2070 is just not cutting it anymore.
